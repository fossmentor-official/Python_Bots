## Requirements (Pythons's libraries)
1. Selenium (For automating web browsers)
2. Flask (Micro web framework)

## Visual Studio Code SetUp
1. Clone the repository-> cd into the cloned repository folder
2. Create a python virtual environment in each respective project folder.

```
# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv

# Windows
# You can also use py -3 -m venv .venv
python -m venv .venv
```
When you create a new virtual environment, a prompt will be displayed to allow you to select it for the workspace.
